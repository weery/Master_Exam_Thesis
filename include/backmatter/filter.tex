\chapter{Filters}
\label{chap:filters}

In this appendix we will introduce image filters which can be explained by the mathematical operation convolution. We will start by explaining what convolutions are and then explain why they are used in image processing by explaining the correlation between an image and its Fourier transform components. Lastly, the discreet version used in images is introduced followed by some important examples and their origins.
