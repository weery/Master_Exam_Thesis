\section*{Abstract}

Extensive use of herbicides in farming is hurting the environment, and limiting the necessity of these are required for a healthy ecosystem. Introducing machine learning algorithms and image analysis to farmers can help them use the harmful chemicals more efficiently. Techniques for extracting and classifying unwanted plants have been studied. Previous work reaching $\sim\unit[85]{\%}$ classification accuracy has been reproduced and improved up to $\sim\unit[88]{\%}$. Methods for quantitative measures is also investigated reaching a $>0.8$ correlation between estimated weed density and the ground truth, and also a $>0.55$ correlation for crop has been achieved. The algorithms used for the result are thoroughly described, for the reader to reproduce, and together with more available data, the method could be used for farming purposes.
