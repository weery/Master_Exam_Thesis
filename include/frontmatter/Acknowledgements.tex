Even though I have worked alone for this project, I have recieved help from several different parties.\\

First I would like to thank my examiner and supervisor Mats Rudemo, for helping and guiding me through this project from the start to the end. Many meetings discussing methods and results was held over the course over a year.\\

Next I would like to thank the people involved in the FarmDrones project. Andreas was the drone guys of the company helped me with their custom built done which I ended up buying from them. Therese showed me their business and guided me through their project. Krum helped me with various programming problems such as setting up the working environment in visual studio and configure tools to it. Lastly, Mike accompanied and introduced me to the company Lovanggruppen and made the road trip to them much more enjoyable.\\

This bring me to Ulrik Lovang and Olof Gr√∂ndahl at lovanggruppen, they took time from their work to help me with this project and especially Olof for teaching me about agriculture and how to recognize different weeds, and also for helping me take the pictures used in this theses.\\

I would also like to thank my opponent for the presentation, Joakim Johansson, for the discussions about our projects and for the opposition itself.\\
